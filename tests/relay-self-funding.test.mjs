// zero:
//   1. the replenish cron actually runs;

//      wallet that earns the fees and burns the settle gas must never go unwatched or unfunded;
//   3. the fee gate must refuse an op with no `op.feeUsd`, not pass it for free;
//   4. the maintenance lane (Bitcoin header attestation) must be priced into the cost model, or every op
//      is priced below its true cost.
