  // vault against the asset it tracks; `fee` in pips (500 = 0.05%); `low` and `high` the ends of the price band it trades in (a swap that would leave it is refused), as multiples
  // of its peg, in tokens of the vault per unit of the quote. Two tiers for each token, and no more: a tight band around the peg, which gives the best price in ordinary times (a
  // $200 pool sells 25 of its tokens at 1.3% slippage in a ±10% band and 19.5% in a full-range one, measured against the pool itself), and a wide one that still trades if the peg
  // breaks. A market is its tuple: the pool's address follows from the tokens, the band and the fee, so changing one here points the page at another pool (a pool the factory
  // already holds for the token is listed either way).
