// What a UTC day's points count for, beyond what each activity scored: a weight per kind of activity, and a multiplier
// for an address that has been active across kinds and on more than one day this week. Both read only public activity
// and apply from a given UTC day forward, so a settled day is never re-priced.
//
// Weights: "20730:cbtcmint=3,cusdmint=2;20760:off" — from each day, those activities count that many times over; a
// later entry replaces an earlier one, and "off" ends them.
// Address caps: "20741:evmpooldeposit=5;20800:off" — from each day, the ETH of that activity an address can count in one UTC day
// (all chains together); points for ETH past it count for nothing that day (they stay in the address's all-time total). A
// later entry replaces an earlier one, and "off" ends them. It limits repeating one deposit many times a day, not how much
// an address can hold, and reads only public deposits.
// Share caps: "20741:evmpooldeposit=0.5;20800:off" — from each day, that activity's points together can be at most that share of
// the day's budget, whoever earns them (the budget is what the pot is before the per-point ceiling trims what is paid, so on a
// day when few others hold points the activity is paid most of what is paid): when more would be counted, every address's points
// for it are scaled by the same factor,
// so the rest of the day is split as it would have been and the capped activity cannot take more than its share however much
// of it there is. Where the TAC-per-point ceiling is in force that is a budget of points (share x the day's budget / the
// ceiling); without one, a share of the day's points. Nothing is limited per address or per deposit, so doing more of it
// still earns more of its share.
// Engagement: "20730:0.25,0.25,2,25;20760:off" — from each day, an address's counted points are multiplied by
// 1 + kindStep for each other kind of activity it has had in the past 7 days (up to maxKinds of them) + returnStep when
// it was active on more than one of those days. A kind counts once it has earned minPoints in the week, and a day counts
// as active once the address has earned minPoints on it; points are counted at their weight, so an activity weighted 0
// is neither a kind nor a day.

// The kinds of activity: where the program is used, not which contract. An activity that is not listed is its own kind.
